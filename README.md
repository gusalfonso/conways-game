## Description
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. This application simulates the Game of Life, providing an interactive experience to observe how patterns evolve over time based on simple rules. 

## Features
- **Interactive Grid**: View and interact with the grid of cells, setting initial configurations.
- **Simulation Controls**: Start, pause, and step through the simulation to observe the evolution of patterns.
- **Pattern Presets**: Choose from predefined patterns to see how they evolve in the game.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Vite**: Build tool for modern web applications.
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets for design and presentation.
- **Astro**: Static site generator that helps build faster websites.
